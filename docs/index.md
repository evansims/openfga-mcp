# OpenFGA MCP

OpenFGA MCP provides a bridge between Large Language Models and OpenFGA, allowing for the creation of agentic AI systems that can:

1. **Query authorization data**: Check permissions and relationships
2. **Modify authorization rules**: Update access control policies
3. **Explain authorization decisions**: Understand why access was granted or denied
4. **Analyze authorization patterns**: Identify potential security issues

## Getting Started

See the [Installation](installation.md) and [Usage](usage.md) guides to get started.

## API Reference

For detailed API documentation, see the [API Reference](api-reference.md).

## Use Cases

- **Dynamic and Context-Aware Access Control**: LLMs interpret natural language to determine permissions based on context
- **Intelligent Policy Management**: Create or adjust authorization policies through conversational interfaces
- **Contextual and Adaptive Security**: Identify overly permissive access patterns and recommend improvements
- **Explainable Authorization**: Provide clear justifications for access decisions
- **Enhanced Productivity and Automation**: Automate access provisioning based on roles and needs
